But remember, no matter what, your training R^2  will always go up when you add more features. With that in mind, you could just implement a 6th degree polynomial transformation, and your training R^2 will be very high.  What will that mean in terms of the bias-variance tradeoff?  Your model will be highly complex and surely overfit. Therefore, you would expect it to perform poorly on the test set."
